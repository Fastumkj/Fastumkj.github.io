*All of these are self-taught/learnt over tiring months...*

My first portfolio website project was a simple yet elegant personal website that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(Soon!). The website featured an "Skills" section that gave an overview of my background and skills, a portfolio section that showcased my previous projects and their descriptions, and a contact section that provided my contact information and a contact form for visitors to get in touch with me.

The website was designed to be responsive and adapt to any device, ensuring that it looked great on any screen size. I also made sure that it was easy to navigate, with a clean and intuitive layout. 

I am very proud of my first portfolio website project as it was a great way to showcase my skills as a developer and give potential employers or clients a sense of my work and experience.

Will definitely be working and updating this website from time to time, any feedback(s) are appreciated :>
